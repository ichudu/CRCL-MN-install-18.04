# CRowdCLassic Masternode Setup Guide (Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04)

This guide will assist you in setting up a CRowdCLassic Masternode on a Linux Server running Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04.

This tutorial will guide you through the steps necessary to setup a CRowdCLassic Masternode on a VPS server that is controlled via your remote wallet. This is the most secure way of configuring a masternode as the 1,000 CRCL collateral resides in your local wallet and NOT within the remote masternode.

Your local wallet is not required to be kept open and you can store it as a cold wallet whilst still collecting masternode payments. Whilst there are other ways to setup masternodes, this is by far the most secure and is highly recommended.

### Requirements
1) **1,000 CRCL.**
2) **VPS running Linux Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04.**
3) **Windows local wallet.**
4) **SSH client such as **[Putty](https://putty.org)** or [Bitvise](https://dl.bitvise.com/BvSshClient-Inst.exe)**

***
### Part A: Preparing the Local wallet

***Step 1: Download the CRowdCLassic wallet*** 

Download the CRowdCLassic wallet from our [Github](https://github.com/CrowdCLassic/crowdclassic-core/releases)

***Step 2: Start the CRowdCLassic wallet*** 

Start the CRowdCLassic wallet !

***Step 3: Create masternode public address*** 

Depending on the number of masternodes you will be running, you will want to create a unique receiving address for each. A receiving address can be created in the wallet by selecting `File - Receiving addresses` in the menu the wallet. Select `New` and click on ***OK*** to create a new receiving address. Create a new address for each masternode that you intend to run.

***Step 4: Generate masternode genkey***

Each masternode has a unique masternode key. This key is generated by the local wallet, however it is placed in the remote nodes configuration file to identify the masternode as your own. The key does not allow any access to collateral or coins earned so it is not a security concern but best practice is to keep it private.

In the debug console `Tools - Debug console` type `masternode genkey` in order to generate a unique masternode key. 
Run this command multiple times if you are intending to run multiple masternodes. Record these details for later use. 

***Step 5: Transfer exactly 1,000 CRCL to each masternode public address***

To allow your remote masternode to start you need to send 1,000 CRCL to each masternode address in your local wallet, as generated in ***Step 3*** that you intend to operate. The transaction needs to be exactly ***1,000 CRCL***. When you make this transaction, ensure that you factor in fees. The windows wallet will show you the total amount being deposited so ensure this reads excacly ***1,000 CRCL***. Just to reiterate, you need to send exactly ***1,000 CRCL*** in a single transaction to each masternode address that you intend to operate.

***Step 6: Record the transaction and output ID*** 

The transaction and output ID from the deposit you made into your masternode public address will need to be added to the masternode configuration file later on. Fetching this information now will make things a bit easier when we reach that stage. To get the transaction and output ID, go to `Tools - Debug console`. In the debug console type `masternode outputs` and the transaction and output ID will be displayed. Record these details for later use.

### Part B: Creating the VPS with Linux 18.04 64bit

***

### Part C: Connecting to the vps and installing the masternode script via Putty.

***Step 1***
* Download Putty [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

***Step 2***
* Copy your VPS IP

***Step 3***
* Open Putty and fill in the ***hostname*** box with the IP of your VPS.

***Step 4***
* Type in ***root*** as the login/username.

***Step 5*** 
* Type in the root ***password*** into Putty.

***Step 6*** 
* Once you have clicked on open it will open a security alert: click ***yes***.  

***Step 7***
* Paste the code below into Putty to ***download*** the masternode install script.

`apt-get install git`

`git clone https://github.com/ichudu/CRCL-MN-install-Ubuntu.git`

***Step 8***
* Paste the code below into Putty, then press ***enter*** to start the masternode installation.

`cd CRCL-MN-install-Ubuntu`

`bash cold_mn_install.sh`

* Add swap file otherwise you may fail to compile!

***Step 9***
* Wait for the installation to ***finish*** (Depending on your VPS and internet bandwidth it may take up to 60 minutes.)

***Step 10***
* When prompted enter your ***masternode genkey*** and press ***enter***. (you can copy/paste this information from your local wallet)
* Wait for the wallet to synchronise fully.

***

### Part D: Connecting & Starting the masternode 

***Step 1***
* Go to the tools tab within the local wallet and click on ***open masternode configuration file*** 

***Step 2***

Create a new rule for your masternode:
 
* `ALIAS` : Any name can be given 
* `IP`    : The external IP address of your remote VPS.  
* `GENKEY`: The key you generated earlier when typing masternode genkey
 in the debug console.
* `TX`    : The long alphanumerical string when typing masternode outputs
 in the debug console.
* `ID`    : The small number (0/1) when typing masternode outputs in the debug
console. 

Click ***File - Save***

***Example***

***Step 3***
* Close your wallet and restart it. Wait for the wallet to synchronise fully. 

Go to the ***Masternodes*** tab and inside that to the ***My Masternodes*** tab, select your new masternode and click on ***Start alias*** and it's status should change to ***PRE-ENABLED***. If you see ***WATCHDOG_EXPIRED*** don't worry, it takes a little for sentinel to send the correct status.

***Step 4***
* Check the status of your masternode within the VPS by using the command below:

`crowdclassic-cli masternode status`

You should now see ***Masternode successfully started***

### Part E: Frequently Asked Questions

***Q1: Iâ€™ve installed the CRowdCLassic wallet, but where are my wallet data files?***

The default directory where your wallet data files will be stored is    
`C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\crowdclassiccore`

***Q2: I have 1001 CRCL, why is my masternode outputs blank?***

You need to create a new address in your wallet, label it, and send EXACTLY ***1000 CRCL*** to your new address. Do NOT check the box that says ***Subtract fee from amount***

***Q3: How do i enable the masternodes tab?***

`Settings - Options - Wallets - Show Masternodes Tab`

***Q4: My masternode status is: WATCHDOG_EXPIRED***

Always confirm your wallet is up to date and synchronized first.
Confirm that Sentinel is installed on your server. If so, is this your very first reward cycle? Try waiting until the first payout. If it occurs again be aware that even in this status it should still be collecting rewards and will eventually correct itself.

***Q5: My masternode status is: NEW_START_REQUIRED***

Go to the ***Masternodes*** tab and inside that to the ***My Masternodes*** tab, select your new masternode and click on ***Start alias***

***Q6: My masternode status is: MISSING***

Either your wallet is not synchronized yet or a restart is required.
Note that even a dedicated server can go down from time to time. When this happens you need to restart your masternode. Also make sure you do not accidentally send any of the ***1000 CRCL*** locked into your masternode, as that will disable it, forcing you to start over.

***Q7: My masternode is stuck on block 'xxx', how can i perform a reindex?***

`crowdclassic-cli stop`

`crowdclassicd -daemon -reindex`

`crowdclassic-cli getinfo` (make sure blocks are increasing)

Check the sync status with:

`crowdclassic-cli mnsync status`

You should now see ***MASTERNODE_SYNC_FINISHED***


***Q8: How many coins will i receive per day/week/month ?***

You can check all the current stats at https://masternodes.online/
